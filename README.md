This project is centered around the creation of flask api application to demonstrate information about hurricanes. The data was taken in from several sources shown below and was transformed and loaded into a psql database shared between all collaborators. This information was then sorted worked up and converted into a json. This generated json was used to produced several graphs using plotly, as well as creating demographic information for perusal. The plots explore the relationship between several factors in relation to damages as well as deaths. In addition to this mapping was done via leaflet to demonstrate the hurricane path.
