// append gif data to the hurricane data
// create function that grabs hurricane.gif data and creates an html element with the href in it
// this will target the div with id=gif
// most likely will be on onChange function grabbing the name/key value from the drop down list to match data
// alternatively we could just append the data and use the existing card the data is displayed in, creating two columns, the right column being the gif
// but we need the data appended to the hurricane data table first
// if the later scenario, should just be able to use exisiting functions with slight modification
